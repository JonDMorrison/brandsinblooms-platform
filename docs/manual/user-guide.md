## Domain Configuration

Your website needs a web address (domain). You have two options:

### Option 1: Platform Subdomain (Included Free)

When you create a site, you choose a subdomain:
- **Format**: yourname.blooms.cc
- **Example**: plantshoppe.blooms.cc
- **Availability**: Instant, no setup required
- **SSL Certificate**: Automatic (https://)

This works great for getting started or if you don't need a custom domain.

### Option 2: Custom Domain (Optional)

Use your own domain name like www.yourplantshop.com.

#### Prerequisites
- You must own a domain (register at GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.)
- You must have access to your domain's DNS settings

#### Adding Custom Domain

1. Go to **Settings** → **Domains**
2. Click **"Add Custom Domain"**
3. Enter your domain: yourplantshop.com
4. Click **"Initialize Domain Setup"**

#### DNS Configuration

The platform provides DNS records you need to add:

**A Record** (for yourplantshop.com):
- **Type**: A
- **Name**: @ (or leave blank)
- **Value**: The IP address provided
- **TTL**: 3600 (or auto)

**CNAME Record** (for www.yourplantshop.com):
- **Type**: CNAME
- **Name**: www
- **Value**: The domain provided
- **TTL**: 3600 (or auto)

**TXT Record** (for verification):
- **Type**: TXT
- **Name**: @ (or leave blank)
- **Value**: The verification code provided
- **TTL**: 3600 (or auto)

#### Where to Add DNS Records

This depends on where your domain is registered:

**GoDaddy**:
1. Log in to GoDaddy
2. Go to My Products → Domains
3. Click your domain → Manage DNS
4. Add each record

**Namecheap**:
1. Log in to Namecheap
2. Domain List → Manage
3. Advanced DNS tab
4. Add each record

**Google Domains**:
1. Log in to Google Domains
2. Click your domain
3. DNS tab on left
4. Add each record

**Other providers**: Look for "DNS Settings", "DNS Management", or "Name Servers"

#### Verifying Domain

1. After adding DNS records, return to your platform
2. Go to **Settings** → **Domains**
3. Click **"Verify Domain"**

**DNS Propagation**: It can take 24-48 hours for DNS changes to take effect worldwide. Don't worry if verification fails immediately—try again in a few hours.

#### Domain Status Indicators

- **Not Started** (gray): DNS records not added yet
- **Pending Verification** (yellow): Waiting for DNS to propagate
- **Verified** (green): Domain is live!
- **Failed** (red): DNS records incorrect or not found

#### SSL Certificate

Once your domain is verified:
- SSL certificate automatically issues within 1 hour
- Your site becomes accessible at https://yourdomain.com
- HTTP traffic redirects to HTTPS automatically

#### Both Domains Work

After setting up custom domain:
- **yourplantshop.com**: Your custom domain (primary)
- **yourname.blooms.cc**: Platform subdomain (still works)

Use whichever you prefer, or redirect one to the other.

#### Troubleshooting

**Domain not working after 48 hours?**
1. Check DNS records are exactly as provided
2. Click "Verify Domain" button again
3. Use a DNS checker tool (whatsmydns.net) to see propagation status
4. Contact your domain registrar support for DNS help

**SSL certificate not issuing?**
1. Ensure domain verification is complete (green status)
2. Wait up to 1 hour after verification
3. Clear browser cache and try again
4. Check that you're accessing https:// (not http://)
